Hi, I am Krishna Prasanth Guttula

I work as network engineer for [Colruyt Group](https://colruytindia.colruytgroup.com) and I spend most of my time writing code for network automation. Primarily focusing on the operational work. Responsibilities include managing a retail-chain infrastructure with over 3 DataCenters, 80+ Branch Offices, 10+ Warehouses and 1000+ stores spread across Belgium, France.

During my university studies, I became particularly interested in the field of Network TeleCommunications, which i later took as a Career.
