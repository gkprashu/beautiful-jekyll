It's been 4 years that i started my career being a Network Engineer. Beginning were the days where i focused in gaining expertise in Routing, Switching and Security systems. I was able to quickly grasp the fundamentals of these technologies and got quite good with them. But with the ever scaling Operational work, i shifted my focus towards writing scripts that ease my Day-to-Day tasks. I was always Self-taught, because there are quite enough good resources out in the web, and i like to study at own pace.
